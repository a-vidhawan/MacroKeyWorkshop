Repository with all required files and instructions for the Macro Key Workshop - first held in Spring 2025.

## First Steps:
- Open Arduino IDE on your computer.
- Snap the Mini keyboard onto the Arduino.
- Plug the Arduino into your computer.
- Download the `.ino` for the workshop from the Arduino INOs folder.
- Upload (->) the firmware to your Arduino. Make sure there are no errors.
- Open Serial Monitor (Tools -> Serial Monitor) and test the controls on the device to check if you are receiving data.

## Installing the Configuration Software:
### MacOS:

- On GitHub, click on the zip file that corresponds to your MacOS version (`MacroPad-MacOS-10_XX.zip`).
- On the right of the screen, click on the "Download raw file" button.
- Unzip the downloaded file, and double click the `MacroPad.app` that appears. MacOS will likely not allow you to open the app yet.

### Windows:

- Click on `Tags` on the home page, and head over to the `v1.0.0-alpha-2` release.
